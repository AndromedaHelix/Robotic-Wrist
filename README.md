# WristTest
 A simple prototyping algorithm written in C++ that models a robotic wrist moving parallel to the floor

# Description

This repo is made to store a small and simple algorithm for maintaining a robotic wrist parallel to the floor at all times. 

It works by knowing the absolute and relative position of the pivoting arm and wrist. 

You can easily implement the algorithm into any language or application. Download latest release code to implement into your project

This code will not receive further updates.

Hope you can find it useful.
